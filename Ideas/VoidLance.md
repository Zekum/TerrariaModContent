**Description:**
The Void Lance is a hardmode magic weapon that fires a long and thin lance of dark energy that can pierce up to five enemies. The lance leaves behind small void rifts at the point of impact, which suck in nearby enemies and deal damage over time. The void rifts last for five seconds and can stack up to three times on the same enemy. The Void Lance can be dropped by the Lunatic Cultist or crafted with 20 Ectoplasm and a Mythril or Orichalcum Anvil.
