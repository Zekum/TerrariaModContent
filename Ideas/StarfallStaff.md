**Description:**
The Starfall Staff is a hardmode magic weapon that fires a large star that travels in an arc. The star explodes on contact with any enemy, tile, or wall, releasing eight smaller stars that fall down randomly. The smaller stars deal half the damage of the original star and can bounce off walls once. The Starfall Staff can be dropped by the Moon Lord or crafted with 20 Fallen Stars and a Mythril or Orichalcum Anvil.
