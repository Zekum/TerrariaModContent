The Starstorm Staff is a powerful weapon that can deal massive damage to large groups of enemies or bosses with its explosive and bouncing stars. The weapon has a high fire rate and can cover a large area with its projectiles. The weapon is best used in open spaces where the falling stars can reach the ground and create more star projectiles. The weapon can also pierce through enemies and walls with its bouncing stars, making it useful for hitting enemies behind cover or in tight spaces.
