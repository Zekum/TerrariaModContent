The Laser Rifle is a hardmode ranged weapon that fires a beam of pure energy that travels in a straight line. The beam can pierce up to five enemies and deals high damage. The beam also ricochets off walls up to three times, changing its color and damage each time. The beam starts as red and deals 100% damage, then turns yellow and deals 75% damage, then turns green and deals 50% damage, and finally turns blue and deals 25% damage. The Laser Rifle consumes one energy cell per shot. The Laser Rifle can be dropped by the Martian Saucer or crafted with 20 Martian Conduit Plating and a Mythril or Orichalcum Anvil.
