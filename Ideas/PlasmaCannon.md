The Plasma Cannon is a hardmode magic weapon that fires a huge ball of plasma that travels in a straight line. The plasma ball explodes on contact with any enemy, tile, or wall, creating a large shockwave that deals damage and knocks back enemies.

The Plasma Cannon can be crafted with 20 Souls of Might, 20 Souls of Blight, and a Mythril or Orichalcum Anvil.
