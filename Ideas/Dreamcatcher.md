**Description:**
The Dreamcatcher is a hardmode magic weapon that fires a web of ethereal threads that spread out in a cone. The threads can hit up to four enemies at once and inflict the Nightmare debuff, which causes enemies to see hallucinations and take damage over time. The Nightmare debuff also makes enemies more vulnerable to other damage sources. The Dreamcatcher can be dropped by the Empress of Light or crafted with 20 Pixie Dust and a Mythril or Orichalcum Anvil.
